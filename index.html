A man who was able to pass the test became One, knowing the universe and gaining the power to change the world. Observers watch the test, and the purified aura is thrown onto an uninhabited planet.</p>

As soon as it touched the surface, a bright explosion illuminated the wasteland, and dust, sand, and small grains of ice rose into the air, forming an impenetrable and dense cloud.</p>
                            <p class="text">A few days passed, the effects of the collision subsided and a white fog hung over the place of the asteroid's fall, which, violating all the laws of physics, did not disappear with the onset of noon.</p>

On the contrary, it seemed to have become even thicker, and waves began to roll on its surface, as if on the surface of the sea. From a distance one could think it was the wind moving the surface, but it was calm on the wasteland, and the cause of the inexplicable phenomenon was the fog itself. With each new movement the phrases echoed in it: "Who am I? Am I human? Am I Aura? Do I exist?" As time passed, the phrases formed into sentences, sentences into memories, memories into awareness.</p>

                            <p class="text">The mist in the desert began to shrink, shrinking in physical size and taking on a human-like shape. Soon the process was over and a particle of aura, which on "Ao" was called: "White light", and resembled a human appearance, was hovering over the surface of the wasteland.</p>
                            <p class="text">The observers rejoiced, the first hardest step had been taken, for out of nothing a mind appears. So another mind will gain power, freed from its shackles.</p>
                            <p class="text">"White Light" looked around, swung to one side, to the other, and lifted his head up to see the great and endless starry sky. Somewhere out there, thousands of light-years away, were the shards of shattered aura: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Blue, Purple. He remembered that he had to pick up the shards in strict order, or else he would risk returning to his home planet and starting the journey all over again. "White Light" flickered, letting him know that he remembered himself completely and rushed into endless space towards the stars, in search of Aura particles, leaving behind his world - past and future at the same time.</p>
                            <p class="text">The red star gave physical power, turning the glow red. The orange star gave a mental star, turning the luminescence orange, and so step by step the Aura, formerly white mist and then "White Light," gained new power, and color.</p>
                            <p class="text">But the main test lay ahead: having found all the lost light, the Aura was to become black light, absorbing all the good and evil of the world within itself, to become everything and nothing at the same time. To become a raging wind and a quiet backwater on the edge of the coast.</p>
